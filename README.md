# Sentiment_Analysis-on-IMDB
The project conducts sentiment classification on the IMDB dataset using TF-IDF, Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and TF-IDF + USE embeddings with classifiers like LinearSVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Random Forest. It involves preprocessing data, vectorizing text, and training classifiers. Analysis includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and classification reports for each method. Through comparison, it determines the most effective approach for sentiment analysis. Leveraging PyTorch and TensorFlow showcases the versatility of deep learning frameworks, ensuring thorough exploration and selection of optimal techniques for IMDB sentiment classification.
